# Python_Terminal_Windows
A very simple console based terminal meant for ease of use commands, so no difficult commands just the common ones

------------------Long Description------------------

This is a very simple command line based python terminal that takes some effort from having to do very simple tasks
it can only do so much right now but I am constantly working on it so there will be more support soon (working on a linux version)
so if you want to keep an eye out follow the repository and enjoy :)
